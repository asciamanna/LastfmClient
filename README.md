#Last.fm Client

A .NET client for the Last.FM REST API.
## Build Status
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e703ayk1nydyngqm)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/asciamanna/lastfmclient)

##Currently Supported

* Retrieve all Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieve all Last.fm albums for a user
* Retrieve recent Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieve top artists for a user
* Retrieve Currently Playing from Service information for a user (scrapes last.fm user page)

##Coming Soon
* Page the all tracks and all albums query results
* Console Application to test the API
* Examples using the API

##Suggestions
The last.fm API is quite large and I'm barely scratching the surface of it, implementing the parts of the API that I am currently using. 
<p>
If you have any requests for parts of the API that you would like implemented drop me a line or go ahead and fork and send pull requests.
