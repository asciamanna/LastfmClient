#Last.fm Client

A .NET client for the Last.FM REST API.

##Currently Supported

* Retrieving all Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieving all Last.fm albums for a user
* Retrieving recent Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieving top artists for a user

##Coming Soon
* Console Application to test the API
* Examples using the API

##Suggestions
The last.fm api is quite large and I'm barely scratching the surface, implementing the parts of the API that I am currently using. 
<p>
If you have any requests for parts of the API that you would like implemented drop me a line or go ahead and fork and send pull requests.
