#Last.fm Client

A .NET client for the Last.FM REST API.

##Currently Supported

* Retrieve all Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieve all Last.fm albums for a user
* Retrieve recent Last.fm tracks for a user
* Retrieve top artists for a user

##Coming Soon
* Retrieve what service name and logo the user is listening from (this isn't currently supported by the Last.fm API but can be easily found via screen scraping).
* Page the all tracks and all albums query results
* Console Application to test the API
* Examples using the API

##Suggestions
The last.fm API is quite large and I'm barely scratching the surface of it, implementing the parts of the API that I am currently using. 
<p>
If you have any requests for parts of the API that you would like implemented drop me a line or go ahead and fork and send pull requests.
